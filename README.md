I put the python files in gender/WillUpload0521/pythonCode/

I put the csv files in gender/WillUpload0521

 - the raw csv files are Top25M.csv and Top25U.csv, all other csv files
 are generated using the python code, but I've still uploaded them for
 you to take a look at if you want
 
I'm not too familiar with Github so let me know if there's anything
wrong with formats or anything lol
